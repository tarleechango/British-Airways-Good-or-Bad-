# British-Airways-Good-or-Bad ?

Is British Airways a good or bad airline? This is part of a virtual internship program in data science offered by Forage in partnership with British Airways.

The internship has two main parts:
1. **Web Scraping for Insights**

The first part involves collecting information from the internet about what customers think and feel when they interact with British Airways. This information is important for any business, including British Airways, to understand their customers better.

The data used for this task comes from customer reviews on a website called Skytrax.

The goal is to gather and analyze this data to discover any interesting or valuable insights that might be useful for British Airways.

The insights gathered from this analysis are summarized and presented in a single slide presentation.

2. **Predicting Customer Booking Behavior**

In today's world, customers have a lot of information available to them, thanks to the internet. This has changed the way people make buying decisions, especially when it comes to booking flights and holidays. If an airline waits until customers are at the airport to try and get them to book a flight, it's probably too late. Airlines need to be proactive and reach customers before they start their holiday planning.

For this task, we used customer booking data to build a smart system that can predict whether a booking will be successful or not. This means we want to figure out in advance if a customer is likely to book a flight or a holiday. It's all about being one step ahead and making sure we capture the customer's interest early in their journey.
